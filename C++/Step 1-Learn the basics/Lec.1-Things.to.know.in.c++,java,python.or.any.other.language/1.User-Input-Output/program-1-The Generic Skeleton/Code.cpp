// The generic skeleton of a C++ program consists of two main components: the library inclusion and the main function. After including the necessary libraries, you declare the main function using int main() { /* Your code here */ return 0; }. This serves as the entry point for your program.//

#include<iostream>

int main() {
  //your code here
  return 0;
}
