// Output with cout
// To display output in C++, you'll commonly use the cout function from the iostream library. However, you need to specify that it belongs to the std (standard) namespace. For instance, std::cout << "Hey, Striver!"; will print "Hey, Striver!" to the console. You enclose the text you want to display within double quotation marks. //

#include<iostream>

int main() {
    std::cout << "Hey, Light!";
    return 0;
}
